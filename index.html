                <p class="hidden-text"><strong>Supervised Learning</strong> is where the data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data. For instance, a supervised learning algorithm for credit card fraud detection would take as input a set of recorded transactions. For each transaction, the program would predict if it is fraudulent or not.</p>

                    <strong>Regression:</strong>
                    In regression problems, we are trying to predict a continuous-valued output. Examples are:
                    What is the housing price in New York?
                    What is the value of cryptocurrencies?
                </p>
                <p class="hidden-text_1">
                    <strong>Classification:</strong>
                    In classification problems, we are trying to predict a discrete number of values. Examples are:
                    Is this a picture of a human or a picture of a cyborg?
                    Is this email spam?

                <p class="hidden-text_2"><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong> is a type of machine learning where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples. Clustering is a common unsupervised machine learning approach that finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.</p>

                        Search engines to group similar objects in one cluster

                        A social media platform wants to separate their users into categories based on what kind of content they engage with. They have collected three pieces of data from a sample of users:

                <p class="hidden-text_2"><strong>Standardization</strong> is when we center our data, then divide it by the standard deviation. Once we do that, our entire data set will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This allows all of our features to be on the same scale.</p>

                <p class="hidden-text_2">In terms of output, two main types of machine learning models exist: those for regression and those for classification.
                    <p class="hidden-text_2"><strong>Regression</strong></p>
                    <p class="hidden-text_2">Regression is used to predict outputs that are continuous. The outputs are quantities that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels.

                        For example:
        
                        Predict the height of a potted plant from the amount of rainfall
                        Predict salary based on someone’s age and availability of high-speed internet
                        Predict a car’s MPG (miles per gallon) based on size and model year</p>
                </p>
                <p class="hidden-text_2"><strong>Classification</strong></p>
                <p class="hidden-text_2">Classification is used to predict a discrete label. The outputs fall under a finite set of possible outcomes. Many situations have only two possible outcomes. This is called binary classification (True/False, 0 or 1)</p>
                <p class="hidden-text_2">For example:

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="hidden-text_2">-> Predict whether an email is spam or not</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="hidden-text_2">-> Predict whether it will rain or not</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="hidden-text_2">-> Predict whether a user is a power user or a casual user</p>

                <p class="hidden-text_2"><strong>Linear regression</strong> algorithm in Python, and how to use the linear regression model from scikit-learn. We learned:</p>

                <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="hidden-text_2">-> The goal of linear regression is to minimize loss.</p>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="hidden-text_2">-> To find the line of best fit, we try to find the b value (intercept) and the m value (slope) that minimize loss.</p>

                <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="hidden-text_2">-> Learning rate refers to how much the parameters are changed on each iteration.</p>
